Yet TODO:

FRONT-PAGE
5: SLICK ARROWS: Fix the styling of Slick arrows
7: NOT FOUND: On Client Page, modify links to go to the proper pages (just the instructions page now)
8: TEST CASES: Create a multitude of test cases to make sure everything works
9: CROSS BROWSER TESTING: Check it in multiple browsers
10: RESPONSIVE CODE: Make sure it downgrades nicely
11: TESTIMONIALS + HOME: Possibly try to get the homepage broken down into separate function calls for the different bits of content
