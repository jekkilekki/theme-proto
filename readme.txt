Yet TODO:

FRONT-PAGE
1. TOP MENU BUTTONS: Remove "active" from menu classes when scrolling or at top - in fact, make menu buttons follow the scrolling
2. BUTTONS: Only mimic the button style, but just change all to <a> links
3. SERVICES BUTTONS: Change "Read more" button style when Service is hovered over
4. PROJECTS + BLOG: Figure out why they don't load properly on my Mac + fix it
5: SLICK ARROWS: Fix the styling of Slick arrows
6: FOOTER: Modify the footer (Child Theme by Aaron, etc)
